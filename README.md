# Dynamic TypeScript Sketchpad

This is a simple web-based sketchpad application built entirely with TypeScript, Deno, and Vite. It demonstrates dynamic HTML element creation, canvas drawing, state management for undo/redo, and a data-driven UI for tool selection.

## Features

**Dynamic UI:** The entire application interface is generated by TypeScript. No HTML is written in the index.html file.

**Drawing Canvas:** A 256x256 canvas to draw on.

**Pen Tool:**

- Draw lines with two different thicknesses ("Pen (Thin)" and "Pen (Thick)").

- Select the pen's color using a Hue slider (0-360).

**Stamp (Sticker) Tool:**

- Place emoji "stamps" on the canvas.

- Comes with a default set of stamps: ‚≠ê, üíñ, üî•.

- Add Custom Stamps: Click the "Add Stamp" button to add your own emoji or text stamps.

- Control the rotation of the stamp (0-360) using the same slider.

**Tool Control Slider:** A single slider dynamically controls the Pen Hue or Stamp Rotation, depending on which tool is active.

**Drawing History:****

- Undo: Revert the last drawing action.

- Redo: Re-apply an undone action.

**Clear Canvas:** A "Clear" button to wipe the canvas clean.

**High-Resolution Export:**

- Click the "Export" button to download your creation.

- The drawing is scaled 4x and exported as a 1024x1024 PNG file with a white background.

## How to Use

Select a Tool: Click "Pen (Thin)", "Pen (Thick)", or one of the stamp buttons.

Adjust the Tool: Use the slider to change the color (for pens) or rotation (for stamps).

Draw: Click and drag on the canvas to draw with the pen. Click once to place a stamp.

Add Stamps: Click "Add Stamp üé®" and type an emoji or text into the prompt to add it to your toolset.

Correct Mistakes: Use "Undo" and "Redo" as needed, or "Clear" to start over.

Save Your Work: Click "Export üñºÔ∏è" to download a high-quality PNG of your drawing.
